For LOOP

#do something to each items



name = ["austin", "rolert", "lulam"]



for n in name:

      print(n) 



the output is 

austin 

rolert 

lulam 



explain: 

first n discribe fist to austin 

and n become austin 

and the next step is printing the n so n is austin so print ( austin ) 

so austin is print out 

and loop back and check agian rolert 

and loop become again so on... 



note: that for loop name is tamporary variable that can only use in for loop statement itself



in for loop indentend is important becuase if some code line is outside the indentend ( to space or not under for loop ) these cods will not excutue in for loop 



if list is int and you wanna know what the value of that? use sum(name) so it's will adding all the number on the list and print it out. [13,24,535] output - 322 (may be xD ) 



the differnet between len and sum is len count the numebers or string and sum adding the numbers

Bacically for loop is a loop that can loop the list or in the range
