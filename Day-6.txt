python is already have a lot of build in functions - checkin docs.python.org/functions



print() len() ectt.... these are functions that already built by Python 

B U T. what if we wanna make ( use ) our own functon? will use 

def name():  



so you good to gooooo.. !!



how do we call the function? just call it's name !! 

eg: 



def print_str():

       print("this is string xD")



print_str() 



the reason I named print_str not print is that name will confuse ( mix ) with function child ( idk what to said I mean print("this is staing xD") so.. just give different names that not smiller with keywords



functions are really really important when you wanna reuse ( using again and again ).



W H I L E loop 

while loop is different from loop, it infinite loop when the condition is trure but it's will stop when false -
